# AXML
Arbitrary Video Editing App

This application will interperet xml files from popular NLEs (non-linear editing systems) and manipulate them arbitrarily.

Eventually I'd like to add content analysis so that the manipulation could actually be non-arbitrary and somewhat contextual.

I'm also planning to add in multi-camera support for live performance and music video editing using audio analysis with tempo and genre detection.
